# Wenqi Jiang

**Data Engineer / Backend Engineer**

My name is Wenqi Jiang. I'm a software engineer with 3 years' experience in **big data infrastructure** and **backend services**, specializing in scalability, high availability, and low latency distributed systems design and implementation. I am proficient in `Java` and `Scala`. Not only that, but I have learned to use `React` and `Flutter` to search for interesting challenges.
Furthermore, I enjoy powerlifting and traveling in my spare time.
