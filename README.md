# Wenqi Jiang

**Data Engineer / Backend Engineer**

My name is Wenqi Jiang. I'm a software engineer with 3 years' experience in **big data** infrastructure and **backend** services, specializing in scalability, high availability, and low latency distributed systems design and implementation. I am proficient in `Java` and `Scala`.

Currently, I'm working with the Ontology Engineering Group (OEG) and studying for a master's degree in Data Science from the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM). In addition to my regular duties, I have learned to `react` and `flutter` for searching for new challenges.
