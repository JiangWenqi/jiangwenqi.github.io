## About Me

Hello, my name is Wenqi Jiang.

I'm now studying a master's degree in **Data Science** at the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM) while working as a **software engineer** at Ontology Engineering Group (OEG).

Before that, I worked in mainland China for over **three years** as a **big data engineer** and **backend engineer**, so I have experience in handling Tbs data, and I am most skilled in: `Spark`/`Flink`/`Elasticsearch`/`Spring` and `Java`/`Scala`/`Python`.

Besides daily work, I am constantly looking for new challenges, I learned to `React`/`Flutter`. Recently, I have been working on working on **_Web 3.0_** in my spare time.
