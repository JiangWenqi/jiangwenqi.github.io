Data Engineer / Backend Engineer

## About Me

Hello, my name is Wenqi Jiang.

I'm now studying a master's degree in **Data Science** at the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM) while working as an **ontology engineer** at Ontology Engineering Group (OEG).

Before that, I worked in mainland China for over three years as a **big data engineer** and **backend engineer**, so I have experience in handling Tbs data, and I am most skilled in: `Spark` / `Flink` / `Elasticsearch` / `Spring` and `Java` / `Scala` / `Python`.

Besides daily work, I am constantly looking for new challenges, I learned to `React` / `Flutter`. Recently, I have been working on **Web 3.0** in my spare time.

- Specification and development of **linking discovery** algorithms, including text similarity and geographic relationship;
- Development of a `Sparql-based` knowledge graph linker using customized `Apache Jena` functions;
- Evaluation of the algorithms with **OAEI-2021** datasets;
- Complement of the master's thesis.

**_Keywords_**: `Ontology` `Graph Linker` `RDF` `Text Similarity` `DE-9IM` `WKT` `SPARQL` `Apache Jena` `OAEI`

## Big Data Engineer

**[TOGIC](http://www.51togic.com)** | _May 2019 - Aug. 2021_ · 2 yrs 4 mos

### Offline Data Warehouse

_Dec. 2019 - Jun. 2020_

- The data warehouse contains over **200 TB** of data and more than 150 tables, including user activity logs and system logs from the Togic App and Webox System, which generate over **300 GB** of data every day.
- The data warehouse structure is **STAR** modelling and is organized into four layers: ODS, DWD, DWS, and ADS, which saved over **80%** storage space and eased the small files' problem on `HDFS`.

**_Keywords_**: `CDH` `Kafka` `HDFS` `HIVE` `Spark`

### Data Statistics System

_May 2019 - Mar. 2021_

- The statistics system was **restructured** based on the new Offline Data Warehouse, and almost all big data components **upgraded**, including `HDFS`, `Spark`, `Kafka` etc.;
- The code was rewritten by using **DataFrames**, and was more readable and maintainable, which **reduced the process time** to 1/4 of the previous one.
- Implemented more than **30 new statistical items** and generated reports;
- Fixed the bugs that the former system caused.

**_Keywords_**: `Sqoop` `Hive` `Spark SQL` `Scala` `Elasticsearch` `MySQL` `MongoDB` `Python`

### Log Collection Service

_Sept. 2019 - Sept. 2019_

- **Restructured** the log collection service to improve performance and stability;

- Used `Nginx` and `Netty` to receive and forward logs, and handle error data;

- Produced all logs into the message queue of `Kafka`, which has five brokers, three data backups, and seven days of log redundancy to **improve the robustness** of this service.
